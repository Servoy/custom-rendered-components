# Advanced Renderers

The Advanced Renderers components are part of the [svyPopupFilter](https://github.com/Servoy/svyPopupFilter) module dependency.
The Custom List component from the Advanced Renderers has been specifically built to render the Toolbar filter's list of the svyPopupFilter module; for more info see the svyPopupFilter [Quick Start](https://github.com/Servoy/svyPopupFilter/wiki#quick-start) wiki.
